Harvard AC209 Final Project

## Requirement
Python >= 3.5

## How to Use
Change the path when reading CSV in the jupyter notebook to the files inside `data` directory and you can run them without obstacles.

## Summary
This project predicts whether a song would become a hit on Spotify based on its traits using both linear and non-linear classifiers.

- Linear
    - Logistic Regression
- Non-Linear
    - K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - AdaBoost
    - Stacking Ensemble
    - MLP

The best accuracy is around 80%.
